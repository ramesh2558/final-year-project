# Detection of Depression Indications in Text Sequences using Neural Networks

A Neural Networks model to classify if a person is showing indications of depresssion or not based on text used in tweet.

## Cloning code

To download the code run

```PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/akashdoppalapudi/final-year-project
```

Then Install the following packages

- tensorflow
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- wget
- jupyter

then cd into the directory and run the following command

```PowerShell
jupyter notebook
```

## Depression Detection

The file `depression_detection.ipynb` will contain main code to make the model and train it.

We can modify the sample size and number of epochs.

## Depression Analysis

The file `depression_analysis.ipynb` will contain some data analysis on the dataset.

## Statistics

The training data of different iterations of sample sizes and epochs is saved in `training_stats.txt`
